## Project Context
I am currently studying Front End Developement at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/). This Tic-Tac-Toe app is the final solo project for Mod 1, assigned and completed about 5 weeks into my coding career.

Goals for this project included:

- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## Installation Steps

If you'd like to pull down the code to your local machine:

1. Make a copy of this repository by pressing the 'Fork' button in the upper right corner and following the prompts
2. Clone your copy of the repository down to your local machine:
  - On your forked repository's page, click the green 'Code' button, select SSH, and copy the URL
  - Run `git clone <copied URL>` in your command line
3. Run `cd tic-tac-thrones` to move into the root directory


## Using the App

1. With your arch nemesis, decide where your alliances lie and pick a player.
2. When it is your turn, click a tile on the grid to claim it for your House.
3. Claim three tiles in a row (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) to stake your claim to the Iron Throne!
4. A draw will be declared if all nine tiles are selected without three in a row being claimed by a single house.
5. Ready to wipe the slate clean and start fresh? Click the "Winter is Coming" button.

## Dev Notes
This project was assigned with only the functioality requirements, giving me the freedom to create an original comp. It was a very engaging and creaive process getting to design and implement my own.

### Wins
- Original Comp
- Fully functional and interactive gameplay
- Dynamic, SRP functions
- Organized Architecture

### Challenges
- Testing game play against winning logic

## Future Iterations
In addition to continued refactoring for DRYness (and as I learn new languages and methods), plans for future iterations include:
  * Toggling the grid background image between fire and ice after each round
  * Displaying an image from the series in place of the grid whenever a round is won
  * Giving users the option to select their player from a list of Westeros Houses before the game begins
